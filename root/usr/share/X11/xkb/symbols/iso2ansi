# This keyboard layout tries to emulate the US ANSI layout on
# a physical ISO layout.
#
# The effects of this mapping are:
#  - the key right to the left shift key is another left shift key
#  - the return key is backslash/bar
#  - the lower key of the two keys left to the enter key is return
#
# enable with
#  $ setxkbmap iso2ansi
#
# (/etc/default/keyboard does not work as of 16.04, see
#  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/console-setup/+bug/1612951)
